# SculptorTech Website Redesign

This repository contains the source code for the redesigned official website of **SculptorTech Pvt. Ltd.** The project focuses on a modern, high-performance user interface with smooth animations and a fully responsive layout.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack Used
* **Frontend Framework:** React.js (Vite)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (for responsive and utility-first styling)
* **Icons:** Lucide React
* **Animations:** GSAP (GreenSock) for the Masonry Gallery & CSS Transitions ( animations taken from reactbits.dev)

## 🚀 Key Improvements Over the Existing Website
1.  **Modern UI/UX Design:**
    * Implemented a professional **Dark & Light visual rhythm** (Dark Services → Light About → Dark Clients) to improve readability and visual engagement.
    * Added a "Glassmorphism" and "Neon Glow" aesthetic to key elements like the Services cards and Contact form.

2.  **Advanced Interactivity:**
    * **Masonry Gallery:** A dynamic, JavaScript-driven masonry layout for the gallery section (using GSAP) that organizes images of varying heights perfectly without gaps.
    * **Client Carousel:** An interactive testimonial slider with manual controls and smooth transitions.
    * **Floating "Enquire Now" Button:** A fixed, vertical call-to-action button that ensures high conversion rates.

3.  **Performance & Responsiveness:**
    * Fully responsive Navbar with a mobile hamburger menu.
    * Smooth scrolling navigation for a seamless single-page application (SPA) experience.

## 🤖 The Sculptor Assistant (Chatbot)
This project features a custom-built **Floating Chat Widget** designed to enhance user support:
* **Rule-Based Logic:** It automatically detects keywords (e.g., "price", "location", "contact") to provide instant answers to common queries.
* **Realistic Simulation:** Features a "typing status" indicator and delayed responses to simulate a human-like interaction.
* **UI/Design:** A collapsible widget that sits unobtrusively in the bottom-right corner, expanding into a full chat interface when needed.
